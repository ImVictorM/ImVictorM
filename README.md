    My name is Victor, I'm a Web Development student from Brazil. I was born and live in Limeira, SÃ£o Paulo. I love technology and the good you can do with it, especially when it comes to accessibility. My desire to be a developer came from a friend who I admire a lot and who taught me that not every job needs to be annoying. I consider myself a calm person and I don't like unnecessary conflict. I like going out with friends on weekends to play eight-ball. A dream I want to realize is to travel around the world someday to learn from other people new cultures and ways to live life.
